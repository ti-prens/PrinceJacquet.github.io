# Projectssssss


My personal projects, in various states of completion:
- Most of them are made for, and are properties of [TIM UPS-INSA](http://www.timupsinsa.com/).   
- If the link redirects here or to a 404 not found page,  this means I haven't written the project page yet ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
- This website is still under construction there is more projects to come, and more detailed explanations as well.


Speed Calculator
----------------

- [SpeedBoard](https://easyeda.com/JacquetPED/Speed-Controller) : An embedded system that calculate the speed of the car and transmite it by CAN Bus to the rest of the car. 
I focused on hardware and [Sofiane Aouci](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sofiane-aouci/) wonderfully took care of the software.


TDB - DashBoard
---------------

- [Hardware](https://github.com/PrinceJacquet/TBD) : It's a simple µC base system with various switches to control certain parameters of the car and give some feedback on the state of the car with some LEDs.  
There is still another hardware iteration to come.  

- [Software](https://github.com/PrinceJacquet/TBD) : While on this project I put at test my 
theoretical knowledge on microcontroller and exercice my C skills.


DMD - Distance Measuring Device 
-------------------------------

- [DMD](../dmd) : This project is all about producing the design of an analog precision measuring device made for a CMI course.  
We used Proteus for the PCB design and determined the right values for our passive components and the best suited amp-op for the different task.



Other
-----

- [Eurekafé APP](../eurekafe) : Using Unity, Vuforia, Blender and some C#, I made a simple (AR) Augmented Reality Android application that gave *life* to some object or picture whend scan by the phone.
