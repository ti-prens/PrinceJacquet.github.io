The following individuals have been instrumental in my learning journey, and I am grateful for the wisdom they have shared with me:

Jonathan Rico : "There is *NO LIMIT* to what you can learn ! "  
Sofiane Aouci : "If you want to learn something, *JUST DO IT* ✓ "  
Yvain Subra   : "There is no I in Team, but there certainly is *WORK* in Teamwork."  
Cyril Royer   : "Whatever the path you take, you will always feel that there could have been a better way. But if you do not *FOCUS* on one, you will get no where."
