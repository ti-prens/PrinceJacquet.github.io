Welcome to my collection of writings!

The articles youâ€™ll find here are a mix of my thoughts and musings on various topics that have caught my interest over time. 

While I donâ€™t claim that these pieces are of high quality or profound depth, they hold a special place for me as they capture who I was and what I was thinking at different moments.

Iâ€™ve chosen to keep them as they are, imperfections and all, because they offer a genuine reflection of my journey and growth. 
Feel free to explore and see the evolution of my ideas and interests.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find something that resonates with you
