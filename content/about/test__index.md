Hi ^^
--------

Welcome to my personal website (￣▽￣)ノ! 

Here, I showcase my skills and projects as an embeded system engineer. 

This is a window into my professional and hobbyist endeavors, visitors can see what I'm currently working on and connect with me for potential opportunities (￣▽￣*)ゞ.

This website also serves as a place for me to store my projects and share my progress as I continue to learn and grow in my field.

Above all, this website is a personal motivator for me to continue learning and exploring new ideas. As someone who is passionate about electronics and the "learning by making" method, I hope to connect with like-minded individuals and provide an enjoyable experience for everyone who visits <(￣︶￣)>.

Thank you for stopping by!

TIM UPS-INSA
---------

The TIM UPS-INSA is the best student association ever o(≧▽≦)o ! 

I might be a bit biased ^^.

The association specialize in building fuel-efficient cars from scratch, and since joining in 2017, I've been able to learn and work on some ~~cuttinnggg-edge~~ (￣▽￣*)ゞ **great** embedded electronic systems. 

To top it off, we've managed to set not one, not two, not three, not ... , but 5 world records＼(≧▽≦)／ !
