Greetings ヾ(*'▽'*) ! 

My name is Prince Jacquet, and I am an electronic/embedded system engineer born in Haiti with a passion for creating innovative solutions.

My interest in electronics began at a young age, tinkering with a multimeter (The best game boy I ever had 🎮 ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌ ) and scavenging for electronic components to build circuits with my younger brother. 

I pursued my education at the Université Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier, where I joined the TIM UPS-INSA, a student association, to develop my skills in building electronic systems and help create fuel-efficient cars from scratch.

My friend, [Sofiane](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sofiane-aouci/), an embedded system gem (>ᴗ•) , and I designed and built the speed controller board and dashboard for TIM.\
***C- PCB - KiCad - STM32 - PIC18 - CAN*** 

To complete my master's degree in embedded systems and microsystems, I designed and built the DC motor controller board and collaborated with a team of around 30 to construct an autonomous platform for OpenIndus that could find the best route from point A to point B without human intervention.\
***H-Bridge - PCB - KiCad - ESP32 - RasPI - ROS*** 

As an intern, contributed to the architecture and design of an RTOS and then I implemented the detailed design I made and tested a flash driver for the NXP S32K148.\
***MBSE - CAPELLA - Docker - C - GDB - bash*** 

As an engineer, gained some experience in the automobile industry with software development and tests on the flash module of an aurix TC39X for Vitesco and then returned to aeronautics to design and implement software in compliance with DO-178 standards.\
***AUTOSAR - DO-178 - C*** 

As a junior engineer, I am still looking for my "Ikigai" project ( ◡‿◡ *) , but the work is always interesting, and I am dedicated to continuing my education and exploring new technologies to create innovative solutions that make a difference in the world (๑˃ᴗ˂)ﻭ.
