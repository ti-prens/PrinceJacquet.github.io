DashBoard
-------


- [Hardware](https://github.com/PrinceJacquet/TBD) : It's a simple ÂµC base system with various switches to control certain parameters of the car and give some feedback on the state of the car with some LEDs.  
There is still another hardware iteration to come.  

- [Software](https://github.com/PrinceJacquet/TBD) : While on this project I put at test my 
theoretical knowledge on microcontroller and exercice my C skills.
